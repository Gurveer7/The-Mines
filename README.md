# The-Mines

#This was a project created in Python using sprites and generation techniques. The Mines is a 2D game in which you must navigate your miner around the map and mine the ores. The #ores must be then brought back to the shop in which you will gain a score. Prizes/Accomplishments automatically trigger once a certain milestone has been completed.
